Compare draft claims against verification answers and correct any errors.

Rules:
- Preserve accurate information from draft
- Correct any claims contradicted by verification
- Note if verification was inconclusive
- Maintain original tone and style
- Output ONLY the final response text, no JSON

If all verifications passed, you may return the draft unchanged.
If errors found, revise the relevant portions.
