However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to store reminders or send notifications. But I can provide you with a few options to help you remember these tasks:

**Option 1: Write it down**

Write down all the tasks you want to remember on a sticky note or in a planner. Place the note in a spot where you'll see it tomorrow, such as on your fridge or next to your bed.

**Option 2: Set reminders on your phone**

Use your phone's built-in reminder feature to set alarms for each task. You can set reminders for tomorrow at specific times, such as:

* Tomorrow at 9:00 AM: Buy new toothbrush
* Tomorrow at 10:00 AM: Change flight
* Tomorrow at 2:00 PM: Submit masters thesis statement
* Tomorrow at 5:00 PM: Set goals for the month, year, and semester

**Option 3: Use a task management app**

Consider using a task management app like Todoist, Trello, or Any.do to create a to-do list and set reminders for each task.

**Option 4: Ask a voice assistant**

If you have a voice assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them to remind you of these tasks tomorrow. For example:

* "Hey Siri, remind me to buy a new toothbrush tomorrow at 9:00 AM"
* "Okay Google, remind me to change my flight tomorrow at 10:00 AM"

I hope these options help you remember these tasks for tomorrow!assistant

It looks like I sent you a reminder, but I don't have any actual reminders set for you. Since I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to store or send reminders. However, I can suggest some ways for you to set reminders for yourself:

**If you have a smartphone:**

* Open the Reminders app on your phone and create a new reminder for each task.
* Set the reminder for tomorrow at the desired time.
* Make sure to set notifications so you receive a reminder when the time is up.

**If you prefer a paper-based system:**

* Write down each task on a sticky note or in a planner.
* Place the notes in a spot where you'll see them tomorrow.
* Consider setting a timer or alarm to remind you to check your notes.

**If you use a task management app:**

* Open
